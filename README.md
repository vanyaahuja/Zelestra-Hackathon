# Zelestra-Hackathon
📌 Objective:
To predict the real-time efficiency of solar panels based on weather data using machine learning. The aim was to help optimize solar power usage and maintenance scheduling under varying environmental conditions.

🛠️ Technologies & Methods Used:

Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

ML Algorithms: Random Forest, Extra Trees, Linear Regression, SVR

Statistical Techniques: PCA, Z-score for outlier detection, scaling, regression error metrics

Project Management Tools: GitHub for version control, Google Colab/Jupyter Notebooks for collaboration
